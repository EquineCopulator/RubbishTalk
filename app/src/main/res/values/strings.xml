        "Thank you for using Rubbish Talk, developed by Equinus. This app displays a slideshow with some text.
        To make it run, you need to grant it the permission to access files on your storage, and put the media files (image, video or audio) and text scripts you want it to display in the specified path.
        Tap up-right corner of the screen to see Help for explanation of other features."

"Media
    Rubbish Talk will choose a file (image, video or audio) in the media files directory to display. Images are displayed with a fixed time interval adjustable in Settings. Audios and videos are played at full length. By default the next media to display will be randomly chosen. However, if plural media files have names in the format of “XXX_01”, “XXX_02”, where "XXX" are the same string, they will be recognized as a sequence, and will always be displayed subsequently and in order.

Script
    Rubbish Talk can run without scripts. If scripts are to be used. A file with the name “script.txt” should be put into the media files path. Basically, the lines from the script will be displayed in order, with an time interval that varies depending on the line length and is also adjustable in Settings.
    Semicolons and indentation, whitespace characters at the beginning of a line, can be used to modify how lines are displayed. To illustrate this rule, in the following example script:

:I slept.
:I played football.
    :I got injured.
    I was hospitalized.
    :I won the game.
:I played cards.

    The script will at first have equal chances of displaying “I slept.”“I played football.” or “I played cards.”. If it chooses “I played football.”, the next line will have equal chances of being “I got injured.” or “I won the game.”. If “I won the game.”is chosen, the script will go back to “I slept.”“I played football.” or “I played cards.” while if “I got injured.” is displayed, the next line will be surely “I was hospitalized.”.

Script Code
    The script code is a scripting language code which can store values and provide interactions. They are given in script files as code blocks with the format ${(some code)} or $${(some code)}. Double dolar signs code will have the return value discarded. Single dolar sign code will have the return value inserted into the string. For example:

$${number=15}
Number is ${number}.
$${number+=1}
The new number is ${number}.

    This will display first "Number is 15." and then "The new number is 16".

    Functions that can be called in the script:

C-like operators.$${n=5,n*=4,n==5?1:0}
Jump n lines forward, minus for backward.$${jmp(n)}
Jumpto the n-th line.$${jmpto(n)}
A random integer from 0 to n-1.$${random(n)}
Metronome, with a period of n millisecond.$${metronome(1000)}
Check whether n is defined.$${ifdef("n")}
Provide the player with "choice 1" and "choice 2", and store the result as the variable n.$${ask("n", "choice 1", 1, "choice 2", 2)}

Topic
    Media and script files are categoried into difference topics. Media files have their filenames prefixed with the topic name and the script file suffixed. For example, for the topic “star”, the media file names should be “star_xxx”“star_yyy”“star_yyy_00”. The script file of a topic is given as “script_star.txt”. An additional topic is the default topic, with non-prefixed media files and a “script.txt”.
    By default, only the default topic medias and lines will be displayed. If a line in the script file contains “=>”, it is interpreted as a script topic change command. For example:

I wanna go to Beta Centauri.=>star

    If this line is triggered, after displaying “I wanna go to Beta Centauri.”, the App will try to find and execute “script_star.txt”. Media topics are accessed by:

Images. $${media(1,"sometopic")}
Audios and videos. $${media(2,"sometopic")}

Include
    There may be good reasons to not gather a lot of media files in one folder. An “include.txt” can help to access media files in other directories. Each line of this file should be a path to a directory that will be searched for media files. If a line starts with an angle bracket, media found in this path will be put into the topic in the bracket disregard of their file names. An example “include.txt” file:

dir1/dir2
dir3
&lt;ok&gt;dir3/dir4
&lt;ready&gt;dir3/dir5
    "
    </string>
</resources>
